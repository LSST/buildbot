BuildBot Implementation Specifics
* Determine if builders' *on-demand start* should be restricted from public 
  * Should some builders be restricted from public start and not others
  * Possibly, determine selection criteria for choosing authorized users of 
    on-demand run-weekly builder.  
    Two possibilities:
    1) use same list that's allowed write access to the svn/git repository; or
    2) on user request and run manager approval, add user id to a 
       separately maintained run-weekly list. 
  (13 Jan 12: TBD)
  SRP NOTE: Starting builds should be restricted from the public.

* Determine what build products, logs, etc should be archived, then implement.
  (13 Jan 12: TBD)

* gitRelease (update-Lsst-Stack master.cfg step) fails with known eups bug.
  (13 Jan 12: TBD; Ticket issued)

* A dependency which is not in the current.list (i.e. a brand new package 
  which has not been released yet) should be detected in dependency list
  generation and then processed with the rest of the dependencies. 
  (13 Jan 12: IN PROGRESS, some of this is done.  need to convert to a CGI
  script so buildmaster and buildslave(s) have access to the same list)

* Trigger Package Build on entry of package name should allow previously 
  unknown git package name. 
  (13 Jan 12:  TBD)

* non-position dependent command line argument code that Steve created for one of the scripts, and getting that ported over to the other scripts 
  (13 Jan 12: SOME DONE: gitTrunkVsTrunk.sh, runProduction.sh; TBD all the rest)

* email handling
  * determining the guru recipients via either
    * scons/eups tag per package
    * trac components CC list
  * chosen:  last git modifier & special lsst-build notification list
  (13 Jan 12: MOSTLY DONE; need to add special lsst-build alias)

* ensure that all buildbot VMs have the following defined and documented:
        EUPS_USERDATA= <defined in master.cfg for each slave>
        $cat $EUPS_USERDATA/startup.py
          hooks.config.site.lockDirectoryBase = None
  (13 Jan 12: DONE; all new builders must invoke: 'update buildbot environment')

* Getting the nightly release build working with the new distribution server  
  (13 Jan 12: DONE)

* Use of manifest list for gitId at start of build process versus using 
  whatever is master at the moment of a build step.
  (13 Jan 12: DONE)

Winter 2012 Milestones for Buildbot Scripts 
  Extracted: http://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/wiki/Winter2012/DevelToolRequirements

* Task: Review and rewrite the buildbot scripts to fix the issues below:
  * build in parallel,
    * Status: DONE for build, NEVER for unit testing due to race conditions
  * use ccache,
    * Status: (ON HOLD - looked at this, but set at a low priority
               compared to other tasks).
  * simplify dependency management,
    * Status: DONE
  * send mail on failure
    * Status: DONE
  * create tickets on failure
    * Status: TBD 
  * ensure easily switched to a new compiler or OS
    * Status: DONE; switch to new gcc version and new OS was not a problem;
              it was a problem for the code it operates upon, though

* Task: Build buildbot script that builds a just-tagged package against its declared dependencies.
  * Status: DONE

* Task: Extend above script to check package's ABI against its previous version
  * if no change, rebuild all packages depending on the just-tagged package.
    * use an ABI checker such as  
      http://ispras.linux-foundation.org/index.php/ABI_compliance_checker and,
    * Status: TBD; currently implemented to determine the set of all packages
                   depending on a given package and rebuild all those. Also,
                   the ABI checker at URL above doesn't exist.

For the venerable gitTrunkVsTrunk.sh, to salt the system with a brand-new 
package by hand:
  $ lsst5
  cd ~/RHEL6/gitwork/builds/TvT/work/git
  mkdir <newpkg>
  cd <newpkg>
  ## determine the gitid of the <newpkg> master
  git clone --depth=1 $LSST_DMS/<newpkg>.git <gitId>
  setup -r . <newpkg>
  scons
  eups declare -c -r . <newpkg> <gitid>
  eups list -c <newpkg>   # Check <newpkg> exists, is current, & NOT LOCAL:

Google Chromium Buildbot Waterfall Doco:
http://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/chromium-build-infrastructure/tour-of-the-chromium-buildbot

Discusses additional builder configurations which may come of interest to LSST:
 * define incremental builder which builds only  changed packages and other 
   libs which are dependent on those changed packages.
   This is our current 'Full' build scenario
 * define full rebuild builders which start from scratch and build in a 
   totally 'cleaned' environment.  This would just need to add an additional 
   build step to sanitize the environment then could trigger the 
   incremental builder mentioned above.


Document also provides: definition of terms, a clear description of each build ,etc. Good prototype.
